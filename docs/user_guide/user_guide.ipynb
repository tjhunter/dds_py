    "\n",
    " * `data_function` is an annotation for functions that take no arguments and return a piece of data that should be tracked\n",
    " * `keep` is a function that wraps function calls. It can be used standalone when the function uses basic types as arguments.\n",
    " * `eval` is used in conjunction with `keep` when data functions take complex arguments.\n",
    " * `load` directly loads a piece of data from its path (without having to refer its generating data function)\n",
    " \n",
