# Changelog

## v0.7.0

Adds a major feature: caching in memory of most recently used objects.

## v0.6.0

This is a major release that changes
the algorithm of calculating the signatures. 
*Upgrading from a previous version will trigger the cache to be calculated again*.

This change is not expected to happen again except for localized bug fixes.
